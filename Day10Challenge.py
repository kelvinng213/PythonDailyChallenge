#Given an integer, create a function that finds and returns the length of the longest binary gap of the binary representation of that integer. A binary gap is the sequence of consecutive zeros in between ones in a binary representation. Reference for binary representation can be found here: https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html



#Example:

#Input: 9, which has binary representation 1001

#Returns: 2
#Input: 529, which has binary representation 1000010001

#Returns: 4
#Input: 20, which has binary representation 10100

#Returns: 1

#Input: 15, which has binary representation 1111
#Returns: 0
