#Given a string, return the character with the most value. The value of a character is the difference between the index of its first occurrence and the index of its last occurrence. If there is a tie, return the character that goes first alphabetically.



#Example:

#Input: 'abcdbcd'

#Output: 'b', since difference between first index and last index = 4 - 1 = 3, which ties with the values of c and d but since b goes first alphabetically, that's the most valuable character.
